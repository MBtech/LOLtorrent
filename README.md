P2PFileSharing
==============
Basic P2P File Sharing system. 
P2PTest.java allows for execution of the program on several computers using node type argument, that can be either tracker, seeder or leecher.
Testing.java allows for testing the program on a single system with multiple seeders and leechers.
Nothing fancy. Pretty basic stuff. Sequential piece selection and dumb peer selection.
